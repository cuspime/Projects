This is a repo for some projects I've worked on for the past few weeks while learning ML. 
Mostly a compendium of some functions and ideas used in Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit and so on.  
  
  
|Project|Description|
|:------|:----------|
|[ChestXRays](https://github.com/cuspime/Projects/blob/master/ChestXRays.ipynb) | This project uses Tensorflow and Keras to build a CNN with the aim of detecting patients with pneumonia. The results obtained by this model are **f1_score=0.9139** and **accuracy=.8894**, which is remarkable. |
|[FOREX](https://github.com/cuspime/Projects/blob/master/FOREX.ipynb) | Foreign Exchange prediction. In this Time Series Analysis we intend to forecast the behaviour of the MXN w.r.t. other currencies. In this project we make use of SARIMAX, VARMA and FB Prophet library.|
|[COVID-19](https://github.com/cuspime/projects/blob/master/COVID-19.ipynb)| The coronavirus phenomenon has alarmed the world and that has waken us up about the implication of pandemias in a globalised world. In this notebook I do a bit of research on my own questions about the COVID-19. |
|[Mediterranean sea](https://github.com/cuspime/Projects/blob/master/Mediterranean_sea.ipynb)| In this small project we make a time series analysis of scalar quantities on a geographic dataset and obtain interactive maps that display the behaviour of quantities like temperature, Chlorophyll, Biomass production and salinity. |
|[Heart_disease](https://github.com/vcuspinera/cuspime-projects/blob/master/Heart_disease.ipynb)| Heart disease is, according to the WHO the number one cause of death globally.  This is specially important after knowing that "80% of premature heart disease and stroke is preventable  |
|[IMDb](https://github.com/cuspime/Projects/blob/master/IMDb.ipynb)| EDA about IMDb |
|[PhD_ODE](https://github.com/cuspime/Projects/blob/master/PhD_ODE.ipynb)| These are the numerical methods we used in a [couple of projects during my PhD](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.99.024046)  to solve the Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) describing vacuum decay triggered by black holes within a higher dimensional model of our universe known as the Randall-Sundrum braneworld model (RS). |
|[Analysis of #LoveIsNotTourism on Twitter](https://github.com/cuspime/Projects/blob/master/Twitter.ipynb)| This project is motivated by the [**#LoveIsNotTourism** movement](https://www.loveisnottourism.org/). International families have been separated by travel bans that do not consider binational couples as a legitimate civil union, hence separating people from their essential ones, forcing them to meet in third countries without travel bans.
Therefore, it is interesting to see the behaviour of a group with a newly created hashtag flag that has already made changes in governmental decisions. This python analysis also leads to a highly interactive [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/leocuspinera#!/vizhome/Twitter_15978796836980/Main_Story).|
