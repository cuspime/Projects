This is a repo for some projects I've worked on for the past few weeks while learning ML. 
Mostly a compendium of some functions and ideas used in Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit and so on.  
  
  
|Project|Description|
|:------|:----------|
|[ChestXRays](https://github.com/cuspime/Projects/blob/master/ChestXRays.ipynb) | Detection of pneumonia patients with image classification through a CNN in Tensorflow and Keras |
|[COVID-19](https://github.com/cuspime/projects/blob/master/COVID-19.ipynb)| The coronavirus phenomenon has alarmed the world and that has waken us up about the implication of pandemias in a globalised world. In this notebook I do a bit of research on my own questions about the COVID-19. |
|[Credit_card_default_kaggle](https://github.com/cuspime/Projects/blob/master/Credit_card_default_kaggle.ipynb)| Machine learning application to identify default payments for a small sample. |
|[Heart_disease](https://github.com/vcuspinera/cuspime-projects/blob/master/Heart_disease.ipynb)| Heart disease is, according to the WHO the number one cause of death globally.  This is specially important after knowing that "80% of premature heart disease and stroke is preventable  |
|[IMDb](https://github.com/cuspime/Projects/blob/master/IMDb.ipynb)| EDA about IMDb |
|[PhD_ODE](https://github.com/cuspime/Projects/blob/master/PhD_ODE.ipynb)| These are the numerical methods we used in a [couple of projects during my PhD](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.99.024046)  to solve the Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) describing vacuum decay triggered by black holes within a higher dimensional model of our universe known as the Randall-Sundrum braneworld model (RS). |
